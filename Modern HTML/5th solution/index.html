            <ul>
                <li>Semantic Tags:- </li>
                <p>HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements (e.g., header, nav, article, section, footer) that provide a clearer and more meaningful structure to web documents. These elements help improve accessibility and search engine optimization.</p>

                <li>Geolocation API:-</li>
                <p>This feature is used to access the geographical position of a user, however, it is not accessed unless the user approves of it. This can be helpful in creating apps like taxi apps, food order tracking apps, and more.</p>

                <li>Canvas Element:-</li>
                <p>It is a top-notch feature that has been made the tedious task of handling graphics easier for developers. With the help of Canvas Element, you can easily draw graphics using javascript. It is  optimum for creating simple animations and drawing photo composition. </p>
