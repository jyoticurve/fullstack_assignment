            My name is jyoti kumari. I passed my graduation from computer science branch in 2020 during corona pandemic.
            I try to get a job but i can't due to lack of skills. After 2 yrs i caught some interest in web development
            then i see your course and i join and i promise myself to get a job or intern as a fresher in next year with
            the help of PW Skills. Hope i take a better decision and your course will help me a lot in that. Thanks to
            PW Teachers and teams.
