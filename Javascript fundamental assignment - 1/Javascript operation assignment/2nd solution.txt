2nd ques- Describe the categorization of operators in Javascript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category.

Sol:- Operators in Javascript are categorized based on their functionality into the following groups:
 1. Arithmetic Operators:- These operators perform mathematical operations on operands. Operands can be numbers or variables.
 Example- 
    // Addition (+)
    const sum = 1 + 2;  // sum is now equal to 3

    // Subtraction (-)
    const difference = 10 - 5; // difference is now equal to 5

    // Exponention (**)
    const power = 2 ** 4; // power is now equal to 16

    // Modulo (%)
    const remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder is now equal to 1

 2. Assignment Operators:- These operators assign values to variables.
 Example-
    // Assignment operator (=)
    const myVariable = 10;

    // Addition assignment operator (+=)
    myVariable += 5; // myvariable is now equal to 15

    // Division assignment operator (/=)
    myVariable /= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 5

    // Modulo assignment operator (%=)
    myVariable %= 3; // myVariable is now equal to 1

 3. Comparison Operators:- These operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false).
 Example- 
    // Equal to (==)
    const isEqual = 10 == 10; // isEqual is how equal to true

    // Not equal to (!=)
    const isNotEqual = 10 != 10; // isNotEqual is now equal to false

    //Greater than or equal to (>=)
    const isGreaterThanOrEqual = 10 >= 10; // isGreaterThanOrEqual is now equal to true

    //Less than or equal to (<=)
    const isLessThanOrEqual = 10 <= 5; // isLessThanOrEqual is now equal to false

 4. Logical Operators:- These operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.

   // AND (&&)
   const isAndTrue = true && true; // isAndTrue is now equal to true
   const isAndFalse = true && false; // isAndFalse is now equal to false

   // OR (||)
   const isOrTrue = true || false; // isOrTrue is now equal to true
   const isOrFalse = false || false; // isOrFalse is now equal to false

   // NOT (!)
   const isNotTrue = !true; // isNotTrue is now equal to false
   const isNotFalse = !false; // isNotFalse is now equal to true
