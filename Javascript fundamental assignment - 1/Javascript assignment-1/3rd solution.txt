3rd ques:- List and describe the five primite data types in Javascript?

Sol:-
1. String: Combination of alphanumeric characters wrapped in either single or double quotes. Strings can include any number, letter or symbol.
Example: "Prabir" or 'Prabir'

2. Number: Any number in Javascript is the Number type, including floats and decimals. Some languages have separate types for floats and integers. javascript does not. Numbers are not wrapped in quotes.
Example: 30, 98.9 

3. BigInt: In Javascript, there is a maximum safe value, which is approximately 2^53 - 1. Similarly, there is also a minimum safe value, which is approximate -(2^53 - 1).
This means that integers less than min safe value or greater than max safe value, may lose precision when represented as a Javascript number. So, for such numbers, we use BigInt data type.
The BigInt data type number can also be treated as a regular number by adding n to it at the end.
Example: 9007199243740991n

4. Null: Null means nothing or empty value. It is often used to indicate that a variable or property has no value. 

5. Undefined: Undefined is a special value that indicates that a variable or property has been declared but has not been assigned a vlaue.
