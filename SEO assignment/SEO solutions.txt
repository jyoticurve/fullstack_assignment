Sol:- A Favicon (short for “favorite icon”) is a small, typically square image or icon associated with a website or web page. Favicon images are displayed in a web browser’s address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and sometimes in search engine results. They serve as a visual representation of a website and help users quickly identify and differentiate between various websites when multiple tabs are open in a browser.
Example:--->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset=”UTF-8”>
<meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”>
<title>Real-estate website</title>
<!---Favicon—>
         <link rel=”icon” href=”favicon.ico” type=”image/x-icon”>
</head>
<body>
<!--your content goes appear here—--->
</body>
</html>


In Example, the href attribute points to a file named ”favicon.ico,” which is a common file format for favicons.
